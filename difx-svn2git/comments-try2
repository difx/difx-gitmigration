* same as try1, the files in branches such as DiFX-2.6.2 don't have any history.

* ... but all of the master_tags have become branches, and the branches/ and tags/ are all present

* DONE (try3+) we don't have the mapping of r1234 -> git hash, it would be good to have.
  "git svn" appends that to the commit messages? 
  try these:
  --add-metadata  # works `svn path=/applications/difx2fits/trunk/; revision=9734`
  --add-metadata-notes  # did not try

* TODO build the result
* TODO build some branches
* TODO basic travis-ci setup
* WAIT rename master to main? -- github is making tooling for end-of-2020

Questions from reading the docs and examples:

* Do we want everything to be git branches (as in try2) or try for tags?
   like so:
    branch refs/tags/v4.4.0
    annotated true  # optional

* the kde docs recommend running "gitk --all" and stare at the tree
   branches that start "nowhere" are bad
   same for tags

* study https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kde-ruleset.git ?
