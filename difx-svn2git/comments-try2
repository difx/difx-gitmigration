* same as try1, the files in branches such as DiFX-2.6.2 don't have any history.

* ... but all of the master_tags have become branches, and the branches/ and tags/ are all present

* DONE (try3+) we don't have the mapping of r1234 -> git hash, it would be good to have.
  "git svn" appends that to the commit messages? 
  try these:
  --add-metadata  # works `svn path=/applications/difx2fits/trunk/; revision=9734`
  --add-metadata-notes  # did not try

* DONE what am I still dropping in try2?
   done try3 README.txt and index.html in top level directory
   applications/ -- 21 in the websvn, 21 in try2
   done try3 deprecated/ -- all missing -- pulseprofile/ has no trunk, maybe others hiding in there
   done try3 doc/difxhelp missing -- has no trunk (but userguide does and is ok)
   ok libraries/ -- missing difxbase, which does have a trunk but it's empty in the tip
      also empty in difx-reposurgeon
      adeller says it was always empty
   done try3 2 release*.pl files in master_tags/
   mpifxcorr -- ok
   setup -- ok
   donetry3 sites -- NRAO ok, missing a bunch of other directories with no trunks
   tests -- ok
   utilities -- ok
   virtualtrunk -- ok
  done try3 try a crash-only policy for unconverted files
   added a ton of rules to try3
   /common/mark5access/branches/NRAO-DiFX-1.1/ChangeLog
   /master_branches/master_trunk/README.txt
     decided to skip TODO ask about this history
* TODO build the result
* TODO build some branches
* TODO basic travis-ci setup
* WAIT rename master to main? -- github is making tooling for end-of-2020

Questions from reading the docs and examples:

* NO Do we want everything to be git branches (as in try2) or try for tags?
  like so:
    branch refs/tags/v4.4.0
    annotated true  # optional
  it worked, but is more awkward than a branch, and the file history is still missing for DiFX-2.6.2 etc

* the kde docs recommend running "gitk --all" and stare at the tree
   branches that start "nowhere" are bad
   same for tags
  Problem: utilities-NRAO-DiFX-1.1 branch appears to start de-novo, probably similar to all other DiFX-N branches? later removed
    in try2 the first checkin is 35cc33e172fd710e39bfc95ff2e6c76c492b63b8
    it's a 17k line diff
    then removed in 9290d2b598d1d1b722a7f97e12598a90ce0b3650, with no further checkins
    TODO consider shooting out these 2 changesets
  Problem: "Walter's branch" mpifxcorr-wbrisken-NativeMark5 appears to start de-novo, was eventually removed in 2011
    in try2 the first checkin is ae7fca37c136e46c25e42bdee105de671fa24bb6
    it's a 49k line diff
    has checkins by Walter Oct 2007-Jan 2008
  So apparently that's not too bad!
