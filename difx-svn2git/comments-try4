## In try4, the rename from trunk/* to ./* is done after conversion.

That appears to have fixed the weirdnesses noted in comments-try3.

I was able to build branches with/without IPP, and master with
IPP. The master build is proof that the weirdness is fixed.

For file history, --follow is needed due to the git mv for trunk

e.g. git log -p --follow applications/difx2mark4/src/root_id.c

## These look problemmatic, all of them appear to delete the file?

## New weirdness (ok this was also in try3)

this applies to aquib? /branch/

added a rule for /branch/ similar to branches in a try5 candidate, did not work??
| rev 354 /DiFXGUI/branch/mpifr_bonn/src/ matched rule: "rules-try5:17 /(DiFXGUI)/(branches|branch)/([^/]+)/"    exporting. 
| add/change dir ( /DiFXGUI/branch/mpifr_bonn/src -> "applications-DiFXGUI-mpifr_bonn" "applications/DiFXGUI/src/" ) 
the branch applications-DiFXGUI-mpifr_bonn is empty despite the above
AHAH it was removed in 2011 r4078
So that's why the *git branch* is empty

so why is master applications/DiFXGUI/branch/mpifr_bonn/ not empty


## This one doesn't have any /branch/ connection

## Additional builds
warts:
--withhops configure.ac needs png12 changed to the actual name of the needed library (png16 on debian (varies by distro)
--withguiserver is IPP-only
--withdatasim is IPP-only
have not tried
--withpolconvert (needs CASA)
