* same as try[12], the files in branches such as DiFX-2.6.2 don't have any history.

* rules-try3 now matches all of the files, so it's a lot more complete
* r1234 svn revision names are now in all checkin comments

* not-actually-bugs

deprecated/{fringetool,vlba_utils} are in release.pl but are not in the git repo

/deprecated/vlba_utils/ was deleted in r4078
/deprecated/fringetool/ was deleted in r4078

they are not actually in the svn checkout either

so this is not actually a bug
