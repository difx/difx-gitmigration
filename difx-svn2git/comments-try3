* EXPECTED same as try[12], the files in branches such as DiFX-2.6.2 don't have any history.

* IMPROVEMENT rules-try3 now matches all of the files, so it's a lot more complete
* IMPROVEMENT r1234 svn revision names are now in all checkin comments

* OK not-actually-bugs

deprecated/{fringetool,vlba_utils} are in release.pl but are not in the git repo

/deprecated/vlba_utils/ was deleted in r4078
/deprecated/fringetool/ was deleted in r4078

they are not actually in the svn 2.6.2 etc. checkout either

so this is not actually a bug

* DONE examine incomplete branches -- no action

pick a branch that's ahead of master -- in applications/ or utilities/
see if I can "inflate" it to be complete and buildable
  mpifxcorr-outputbands -- 88 behind, 33 ahead -- ok this is just mpifxcorr
    test1: branch mpifxcorr-outputbands, merge master
       a billion conflicts at the merge
    test2: branch master, merge mpifxcorr-outputbands
      a billion conflicts at the merge
  libraries-difxio-outputbands 88 behind, 13 ahead -- empty
utility to print the date of the last checkin in every branch, so we can see which ones are stale?
  github shows this, so not really needed

* Examine the changes in try3

BUG: /applications/*/trunk not being resolved, 6 directories, /libraries/*/trunk not being resolved, 3 directories
  This worked in try2
  The only change in try3 was to add common to the list ?
  in try3, both libraries/* and libraries/*/trunk are populated with files -- ah but the trunk files are coming from the build ?
  POST BUILD:  
    example mark5access in DiFX-2.6.2-ci
      Makefile.am in .
      Makefile and Makefile.in in trunk/
    and in mark5access master
      Makefile.am in .
      Makefile and Makefine.in and Makefile.am in trunk/
  PRE BUILD:
    trunk/ does not exist
    building 2.6.2, trunk doesn't spring into existance
    cleaned up
    master: lots of trunk/
      libraries/mark5access, trunk/AUTHORS is smaller (older?) than AUTHORS
        April 2017 checkin to AUTHORS, also May 2010
        mark5access/trunk/AUTHORS is svn path=/common/difxio/trunk/; revision=752 (in 2008)
        mark5access/AUTHORS was created in svn path=/libraries/mark5access/trunk/; revision=2203 (in 2010)
    similar problem with branches/
BUG:
  reverse problem: libraries/mark5access/doc/Makefile.am in DiFX-2.6.2 branch and not master
     in git, . has 2 guides and trunk has Makefile.am and the 2 guides
     the two guides are different in trunk and . -- trunk is ancient
  this is totally an artifact in git? svn seems fine
     ./git-trunk-collisions.py difx-svn2git-try3
  stderr rules
    rev 35 /common/mark5access/trunk/doc/Makefile.am matched rule: "rules-try3:61 /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/trunk/"    exporting. 
    add/change file ( /common/mark5access/trunk/doc/Makefile.am -> "master" "common/mark5access/doc/Makefile.am" ) 
    rev 41 /common/mark5access/trunk/doc/Makefile.am matched rule: "rules-try3:61 /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/trunk/"    exporting. 
    add/change file ( /common/mark5access/trunk/doc/Makefile.am -> "master" "common/mark5access/doc/Makefile.am" ) 



BUG? applications/calcserver/trunk in DiFX-2.5 but not other similar branches from master_tags ??
  ? does this depend on the state of the repo when the tags were made ? 

match /(vlba_utils|difx_monitor|DiFXGUI)/
  # added in try3 to resolve crashes with no wildcard -- apprently these were later moved into utilities/ ?
  # TODO check try2 for the history of these files
  # TODO compare with try3 history of thse files
applications/DiFXGUI
applications/difx_monitor
vlba_utils is gone?

match /utilities/([^/]+)/trunk/
  # added in try3 for no wildcard crash
  # example1: calc, does not collide OK
  # example2: filemanip, does collide with utilities/trunk/filemanip OK
  utilities/filemanip vs utilities/trunk/filemanip
  filemanip/extract_second5B.py not in the trunk

match /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/trunk/
  # common added in try3 OK
  in master with \1\2 prefix
  are there any collisions? -- can't be, everything is in trunk or branches
  nothing in the final repo
  what was that command to show deleted git files?
  git log --diff-filter=D --summary
  common was renamed to libraries in 2008
  let's follow one file libraries/vdifio/README

match /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/branches/([^/]+)/
  # common added in try3 OK
  all in branches

OK match /(setup|tests|deprecated)/  # try3 added deprecated
