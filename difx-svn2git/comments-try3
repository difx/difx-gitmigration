* EXPECTED same as try[12], the files in branches such as DiFX-2.6.2 don't have any history.

* IMPROVEMENT rules-try3 now matches all of the files, so it's a lot more complete
* IMPROVEMENT r1234 svn revision names are now in all checkin comments

* OK not-actually-bugs

deprecated/{fringetool,vlba_utils} are in release.pl but are not in the git repo

/deprecated/vlba_utils/ was deleted in r4078
/deprecated/fringetool/ was deleted in r4078

they are not actually in the svn 2.6.2 etc. checkout either

so this is not actually a bug

* TODO incomplete branches

pick a branch that's ahead of master
see if I can inflate it to be complete and buildable
utility to print the date of the last checkin in every branch?

* clear the TODOs in rules-try3

BUG: /applications/*/trunk not being resolved, 6 directories, /libraries/*/trunk not being resolved, 3 directories
  This worked in try2
  The only change in try3 was to add common to the list ?

BUG? applications/calcserver/trunk in DiFX-2.5 but not other similar branches from master_tags ??
 

match /(vlba_utils|difx_monitor|DiFXGUI)/
  # added in try3 to resolve crashes with no wildcard -- apprently these were later moved into utilities/ ?
  # TODO check try2 for the history of these files
  # TODO compare with try3 history of thse files
applications/DiFXGUI
applications/difx_monitor
vlba_utils is gone?

match /utilities/([^/]+)/trunk/
  # added in try3 for no wildcard crash
  # example1: calc, does not collide OK
  # example2: filemanip, does collide with utilities/trunk/filemanip OK
  utilities/filemanip vs utilities/trunk/filemanip
  filemanip/extract_second5B.py not in the trunk

match /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/trunk/
  # common added in try3 OK
  in master with \1\2 prefix
  are there any collisions? -- can't be, everything is in trunk or branches
  nothing in the final repo
  what was that command to show deleted git files?
  git log --diff-filter=D --summary
  common was renamed to libraries in 2008
  let's follow one file libraries/vdifio/README

match /(applications|doc|libraries|sites|common)/([^/]+)/branches/([^/]+)/
  # common added in try3 OK
  all in branches

OK match /(setup|tests|deprecated)/  # try3 added deprecated
