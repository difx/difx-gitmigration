Done:

* master branch builds in travis-ci
* some branches build in travis-ci
* /trunk/ is gone from the master branch
* find all big files (test data?) and consider dropping them

Todo:

* incrementally update difx-mirror to the latest and do that for all future tryN attempts
* find if the history has any big files that were deleted long ago
* switch to the new github standard of calling the main branch "main"

Before shipping:

* author map -- ask every author what email they would like to use. Needs to tie into their github ID, if they already have one.

Followups:

* trac to github issue migration https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/trac/difx/
* looks like lots of tools that do this, each abandoned by its author after they finished the migration they cared about
