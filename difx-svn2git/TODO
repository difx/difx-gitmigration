Important decisions:

* mimic git norms, so make /trunk/ disappear from file paths
* there are 2 large binary files that could be vaporized to reduce repo size by 25%, but, the repo isn't very large
* a few 

Done:

* master branch builds in travis-ci
* some branches build in travis-ci
* /trunk/ is gone from the master branch
* found big files (test output, ephemerides) and decided to keep them

Todo:

* incrementally update difx-mirror to the latest and do that for all future tryN attempts

Before shipping:

* author map -- ask every author what email they would like to use. Needs to tie into their github ID, if they already have one.

Followups:

* switch to the new github standard of calling the main branch "main"
* trac to github issue migration https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/trac/difx/
** looks like lots of tools that do this, each abandoned by its author after they finished the migration they cared about
